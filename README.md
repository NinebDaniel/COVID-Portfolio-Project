# COVID Portfolio Project
### Introduction

Welcome to my COVID Data Analysis Portfolio Project! In this project, I demonstrate my SQL skills by analyzing COVID-19 data gathered from Jan 2020 - Apr 2021 to extract meaningful insights and present them in an informative manner. This project showcases my expertise in various SQL concepts, including Joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.
### Features

    Data Exploration: Utilized SQL Joins and CTEs to combine multiple datasets and explore relationships between COVID data and demographic information.
    Temporal Analysis: Employed Temp Tables and Window Functions to calculate rolling averages, trends, and other temporal metrics.
    Statistical Aggregations: Utilized Aggregate Functions to compute key statistics like total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.
    Data Visualization: Created Views to simplify complex queries and facilitate data visualization tools' integration.

### SQL Skills Demonstrated

    Joins: Leveraged different types of Joins to merge data from various tables effectively.
    CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Used CTEs to improve query readability and simplify complex logic.
    Temp Tables: Employed Temporary Tables to store intermediate results and streamline analysis.
    Window Functions: Utilized Window Functions to perform calculations across result sets and generate insightful summaries.
    Aggregate Functions: Calculated aggregate values such as sums, averages, and counts to derive essential statistical information.
    Creating Views: Constructed Views to encapsulate complex queries and enhance reusability.
    Converting Data Types: Ensured data consistency and accuracy by appropriately converting data types.

### Data Source

The COVID data used in this project was obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, and it covers cases, deaths, vaccinations, and other related metrics for different regions.

### Usage

This project can be used to gain insights into the COVID-19 pandemic's impact across different regions. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the trends, patterns, and statistical analysis of COVID data.

### Technologies used

    SQL (Structured Query Language)
    Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

### Acknowledgments

I would like to thank AlexTheAnalyst for their guidance throughout the development of this project. I would also like to express my gratitude to Coursera's Google Data Analytics course for providing me with a comprehensive and invaluable learning experience in SQL.
